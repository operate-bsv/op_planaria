# Operate | Planaria

A Neon Planaria instance for indexing Ops (Operate functions).

## About Operate

Operate is a toolset to help developers build applications, games and services on top of Bitcoin (SV). It lets you write functions, called "Ops", and enables transactions to become small but powerful programs, capable of delivering new classes of services layered over Bitcoin.

## Developing

This Planaria is designed to be used in conjunction with [Operate | API](https://github.com/operate-bsv/op_api). The API code contains the database schema with migrations, which must be run before the Planaria is started.

To run the Planaria locally:

* Install dependencies with `yarn install`
* Start the Planaria with `yarn run index`
